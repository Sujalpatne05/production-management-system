Execution Guidelines
- Track progress with the todo list tool and mark steps as completed with brief summaries.
- Keep communication concise; avoid full command outputs unless needed.
- Use the current directory as working root; create only necessary folders (e.g., .vscode for tasks).
- Install only extensions explicitly requested.
- Prefer placeholders only when noted; avoid unnecessary media or links.
